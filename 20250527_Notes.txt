For change in sample size, is 10000->1000>100 still enough? (yes)
Compare xporegress with decreasing sample sizes or only at 10000-10000? (with decreasing sample sizes)

(see notes on paper)

Is the idea here to work all the way through the process of model selection and prediction?

Is a partial linear model as in (3) reasonable for this?

(a) is naive to information in (b), right? So (a) is a priori model selection, then (b) adds priors?

In (b), are the robustness checks ex post to show that our "devised" model is the right choice?

In (c), no interactions needed, right? (yep)
