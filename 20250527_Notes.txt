CV_4, SE of CV_4 are results for four-fold CV and not for the fourth CV w/in four-fold CV, right?

Confirming set of x1-x6, products, cross-products. What's the right approach to cross-product computation in Stata?
 - Stata docs detail application of crossprod() in computing coefficient matrices but not in regular regression commands
Check results for adaptive lasso.
Check that selection of regressors significant at alpha = 0.05 is correct.

For change in sample size, is 10000->1000>100 still enough?
Note typo in xinteract global
Compare xporegress with decreasing sample sizes or only at 10000-10000?

 - Replicating most of Section 28.16 as well as 28.17? Also, all three panels of Fig. 28.2 or only (c) as in Section 28.17?
 - "Setting" theta hat is an estimator or a generic statement of an estimator or neither?
 - "Class of model selection estimators" is a generic statement of an estimator of estimators or of models?
 - Point of Section 28.16 is that, depending on parameters lambda and K, model selection might make outcomes worse, but
    - Does that hold with crossfold validation as a method that varies sample sizes? Could varying sample size show conditions?
    - Hansen states "Unfortunately it is impossible to known a priori the appropriate models." A priori to selection or to what?
 - Point of Section 28.17 is that inference of B_1_hat could be impacted by model selection. Then
    - is that impact ex post to model selection (w/ reference to a priori question above)?
    - is preceding statement about inference for B_2 something we should replicate in detail?
    - hang on, so the real point is that the impact of model selection on B_1_hat depends on rho (corr(B_1, B_2))?
    - and then impact varies with relative magnitudes of B_1, B_2 (small or large B_2 fine, intermediate values distorting)
 - Generally, is Fig. 28.2 (c) really related to (a)-(b) or are they just grouped for a more convenient layout in print?

Is the idea here to work all the way through the process of model selection and prediction?

Is a partial linear model as in (3) reasonable for this?

(a) is naive to information in (b), right? So (a) is a priori model selection, then (b) adds priors?

In (b), are the robustness checks ex post to show that our "devised" model is the right choice?

In (c), no interactions needed, right?
